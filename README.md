Hello!

In this SQL-project I have conducted a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global layoffs dataset

Statistical Analysis: Identified maximum layoffs, companies with 100% layoffs, and calculated summary statistics.

Insights on Trends: Analyzed which companies, industries, and countries were most affected by layoffs and tracked layoffs over time.

Advanced Analysis: Used window functions to rank companies by layoffs and calculated rolling totals to visualize cumulative impacts.

If there are any questions or further clarifications needed, feel free to reach out to me at my email: fmoreno140802@gmail.com :)
